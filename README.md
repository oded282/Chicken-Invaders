This is my implementation for the classic Space Invaders game, written (using the same infrastructure and tools as my Arkanoid game)
in Java as a project in the Object-Oriented course I took at the 1st year in Bar Ilan University. 

the makefile has 3 targets:

1. compile: compiles all packages in the src directory, using the resources in the directory with
the same name, and using the biuoop jar and the tools provided by it.

2. run: runs the game after compiling with the "compile" target.

3. jar: generates the portable jar, which can later be moved and executed from any
other computer that runs JVM.
